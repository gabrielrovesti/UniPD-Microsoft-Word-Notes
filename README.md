# UniPD-Swiss-Knife-Notes-Slides

In this repo, you will find notes/projects templates for the following notes:

- _Microsoft Word_ (based on my Master Degree files, the "Simple (for real)" and a generic UniPD project)

- _LaTeX_ (based on existing templates minimalized)

- Typst (based on Alberto Lazari notes and edited accordingly)

- _Markdown_ (easy and simple, like I would do)

You will also find the following slides templates:

- _Beamer_ (LaTeX) slides, based on a minimal working example (Generic) and Francesco De Faveri Beamer Template (Beamer Slides)

- _Powerpoint_, based on the existing UniPD template of DM Math and edited accordingly

- _Typst_, based on existing templates, mainly of Augusto Zanellato inspiration
